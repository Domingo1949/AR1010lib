The AR1010 FM Receiver Breakout Board is a miniature FM radio receiver whose parameters can be controlled over an I2C (two-wire) or an SPI (three-wire) serial interface, thus making it ideal for connection to an Arduino.

This library uses the I2C serial protocol, accessed through the Arduino's analog in pins 4 & 5. It allows for custom initialisation, and the setting of tuning frequency, volume, hardmute and softmute values. Although the library probably isn't feature complete it shouldn't be difficult to add in higher-level functions using the available programming guide* and some of the lower-level functions available in the library.

*The programming guide for the Airoha AR1000 (version 0.81, RevF) is also suitable for the AR1010, and contains accurate register maps of the module's functionality.
